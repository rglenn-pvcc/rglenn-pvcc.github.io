                <p>In December 1965, John F. Tinker, 15, Christopher Eckhardt, 16, went to high schools in Des Moines, Iowa
                    and Mary Beth Tinker, 13, went to a junior high. These three students joined Eckhardt's parents and friends
                    in wearing black armbands during the holiday season to publicize their support
                    of a truce and their disgreement to the war in Vietnam.<br><br>
                    The principals of the schools in Des Moines heard of this plan to wear the black armbands in protest of the
                    the war and adopted a policy on December 14 that any student wearing an armband to school would be asked to remove it, and
                    if they refused they would be suspended until they returned without their armband. The Tinkers and Eckhardt
                    were aware of this new policy.<br><br>
                    On December 16, Mary Beth and Christopher wore black armbands to their schools and John Tinker the following day.
                    They were all suspended and did not return until the planned day to remove the armbands, New Year's Day.<br>
                    During this time, the father's of the students sued the school board for violating their children's right
                    to free speech, seeking nominal damages. The U.S. Disctrict court for the Southern District of Iowa sided
                    with the school's position, ruling that the armbands would disrupt learning.<br><br>
                    The students appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit but lost and took the 
                    case to the Supreme Court of the United States.<br><br>
                    Argued by the Supreme Court on Nov. 12, 1968 and decided on Feb. 24, 1969.<br><br>
                    The question posited to the Supreme Court was "Does a prohibition against the wearing of
                    armbands in public school, as a form of symbolic protest, violate the students' freedom
                    of speech protections gaurenteed by the First Amendment?"

                <p>Justice Abe Fortas delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. They maintained
                    that the armbands represented pure speech that separate from the actions or
                    conduct of those participating in it. They also maintained that stepping on to
                    school property did not abolish their rights to freedom of speech. The school officials
                    would need to prove that the actions or conduct of the students would "materially and substantially interfere"
                    with school operations. The school's actions appeared to be out of a fear of possible disruptions rather than
                    actual disruption. Justice Fortas writes the courts majority opinion:<br<br>
                    "In our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism.
                     School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students.
                      Studentsâ€¦ are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect,
                       just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State.
                        In our system, students may not be regarded as closed-circuit recipients
                         of only that which the State chooses to communicate.
                          They may not be confined to the expression of those sentiments that are officially approved.
                           In the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech,
                            students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views."<br><br>
                    In a concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that children are not gaurenteed the full extent
                    of First Amendment rights, and Justice Byron R. White wrote another concurring opinion in which he noted that
                    the majority's opinion relies on a distinction between communcation through words and communcation
                    through action.<br><br>
                    In a dissenting opinion, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote that the First Amendment does not provide
                    the right to express any opinion at any time. In another dissenting opinion, Justice John M. Harlan argued
                    that school officials should be given a wider range of authority to maintain order unless their actions
                    come from anything other than a legitimate school interest.

                    Only 5 out of 18000 students wore black armbands, and when returning to school after
                    the new year, they wore all black for the remainder of the year while fighting their case.<br><br>
                    They were represented by the ACLU and fought a four year long court battle that ended with
                        the historic decision<br><br>
                    This ruling remains frequently cited over the years and has defended the right of students
                        to wear anti-abortion armband, a pro-LGTBQ T-shirt, and shirts of critical figures.<br><br>
                    Since this landmark decision, students have been able to exercise their freedom of speech at
                        school in ways that their conduct does not actively disrupt learning without fear of unlawful
                        reprimand.
