    <tr>
		<td>machine language</td>
		<td>a computer programming language consisting of binary
       or hexadecimal instructions which a computer can respond to directly.</td>

		<td>debugger</td>
		<td> a computer program that assists in the detection and correction of errors in
       other computer programs.</td>

    <tr>
		<td>assembler</td>
		<td> a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of 
      bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations. 
        </td>

      to communicate directly with a computer's hardware</td>

      source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. </td>

		<td>formal language</td>
		<td>a set of strings of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. 
      A formal language can be specified either by a set of rules
       (such as regular expressions or a context-free grammar) 
       that generates the language, or by a formal machine that accepts 
       (recognizes) the language.</td>

		<td>software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine,
       and can therefore be used on any machine. </td>

    <tr>
		<td>high-level programming language</td>
		<td> any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly
       programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
		<td>object-oriented programming (OOP)</td>
		<td>a computer programming model that organizes
       software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. </td>

                   a fraction represented in decimal format.</li>
                <li>string: a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
                   The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed,

		<td>function</td>
		<td>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

		<td>Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
